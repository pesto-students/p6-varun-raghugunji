1.  When a user enters an URL in the browser,
    how does the browser fetch the desiredresult ?
Ans.A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
    It is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. 
    It is also referred to as a web address. 
    URLs consist of multiple parts, including a protocol and domain name, that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.
    End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list,or an email in another application.

   *What is the main functionality of the browser?
    The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. 
    The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content. 
    
   *High Level Components of a browser
    The user interface: this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu, etc. 
                        Every part of the browser display except the window where you see the requested page.

    The browser engine: marshals actions between the UI and the rendering engine.

    The rendering engine: responsible for displaying requested content. 
                          For example if the requested content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.

    Networking: for network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.

    UI backend: used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. 
                This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. 
                Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.

   *Rendering engine and its uses.
    A rendering engine is software that draws text and images on the screen. 
    The engine draws structured text from a document (often HTML), and formats it properly based on the given style declarations (often given in CSS).
